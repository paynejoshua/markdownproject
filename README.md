# Title
Markdown Project

## Project Description
This project involved using node to dynamically creating a markdown file that a developer may be creating. 

## Usage
When using this application be sure to npm i inquirer and npm i path as these will be needed for the application to run. In your command line simply type node index.js and the command line will prompt you with questions about your project. Once you are done a README.md file will be created with basic editing already completed with your answers filled out. Enjoy!

## My Experience
This project was a little complex as I didn't quite understand how to grab information being provided through the command prompts. Once I was able to get over this hurdle the rest of the project fell into place. Before this assignment I had a hard time understanding where to place node in my mind in terms of it's practical applicaiton. After completing this project I see the massive benefits to this language and look forward to diving into it more.
